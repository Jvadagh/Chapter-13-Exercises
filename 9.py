9. Develop a Circle class that, like the Rectangle class above, provides methods to compute perimeter
and area. The Rectangle instance variables are not appropriate for circles; specifically, circles do
not have corners, and there is no need to specify a width and height. A center point and a radius more
naturally describe a circle. Build your Circle class appropriately.
